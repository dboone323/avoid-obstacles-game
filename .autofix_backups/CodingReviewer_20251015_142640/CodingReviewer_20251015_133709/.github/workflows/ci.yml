This is a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for the CodingReviewer Swift project, including build and test on multiple macOS versions, code quality checks (SwiftLint and SwiftFormat), test execution with coverage reporting, artifact generation and deployment preparation, AI-enhanced analysis integration (if Ollama available), performance benchmarking, security scanning, and automated dependency updates. It is production-ready with proper error handling and notifications.
