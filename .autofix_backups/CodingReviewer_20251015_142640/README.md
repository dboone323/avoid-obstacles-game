# CodingReviewer README

## Project Overview

CodingReviewer is a Swift-based project designed to automate code reviews for developers. The primary purpose of this project is to provide an efficient and effective way to review code, helping to improve the quality and maintainability of software.

## Features List

*   Automated code analysis
*   Code formatting and cleanup
*   Error detection and reporting
*   Performance optimization suggestions
*   Integration with popular development tools (e.g., Xcode, Git)

## Installation Instructions

To use CodingReviewer, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository using `git clone` command.
2.  Install the required dependencies by running `pod install` in your terminal.
3.  Build and run the project using `swift build` and `./runner`.

Note: This project uses CocoaPods for dependency management. Ensure you have Xcode installed on your system to build and run the project.

## Usage Examples

### Running Tests

To run tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./Tests/RunnerTests.swift -c ./Tests/CodingReviewerTests.swift
```

This will run all test cases in `CodingReviewerTests.swift` using the runner from `runnerTests.swift`.

### Generating Report

You can generate a report by running the `package` script with the following command:

```bash
./Package.swift -g
```

This will output a formatted report containing suggestions and recommendations for code improvements.
