This workflow is designed to automate various tasks for your iOS/macOS Swift project, CodingReviewer. It includes the following jobs:

1. Build and Test on multiple macOS versions: This job installs Xcode on a Mac running macOS-latest, checks out the code from the repository, installs SwiftLint and SwiftFormat, runs SwiftLint and SwiftFormat on all .swift files, builds the project using Xcodebuild test, and finally, tests the project with coverage reporting.
2. Code Quality Checks: This job installs SwiftLint and SwiftFormat, runs SwiftLint on all .swift files, and runs SwiftFormat with the --in-place flag to update the code style in place.
3. Test Execution with Coverage Reporting: This job installs Xcode, builds the project using xcodebuild build, archives the project, and generates a coverage report.
4. Artifact Generation and Deployment Preparation: This job installs Xcode, builds the project using xcodebuild build, archives the project, and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
5. AI-Enhanced Analysis Integration (Ollama): This job installs Ollama, runs Ollama analyze on all .swift files, and generates a report of any issues found.
6. Performance Benchmarking: This job installs Xcode, builds the project using xcodebuild build and test, and performs performance benchmarking using xcodebuild benchmark.
7. Security Scanning: This job installs Xcode, builds the project using xcodebuild build and test, and scans the project for security vulnerabilities using xcodebuild scan.
8. Automated Dependency Updates: This job installs Swift Package Manager, updates all dependencies using swift update --all.

Note that this is a comprehensive workflow that can be customized to fit your specific needs. You may need to modify some of the steps or add additional jobs depending on your project's requirements.
