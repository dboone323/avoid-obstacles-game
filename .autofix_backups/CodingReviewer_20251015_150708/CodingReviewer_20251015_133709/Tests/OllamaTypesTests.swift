```swift
import XCTest
@testable import Ollama

class OllamaTests: XCTestCase {

    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        // Put setup code here. This method is called before the invocation of each test method in the class.
    }

    override func tearDown() {
        // Put teardown code here. This method is called after the invocation of each test method in the class.
        super.tearDown()
    }

    func testExample() {
        // This is an example of a functional test case.
        // Use XCTAssert and related functions to verify your tests produce the correct results.
        let result = Ollama.generate("hello world")
        print(result)
        XCTAssertEqual(result, "olla, olla!")
    }

    func testPerformanceExample() {
        // This is an example of a performance test case.
        self.measure {
            // Put the code you want to measure the time of here.
        }
    }
}
```

This is just an example, and it does not cover all the possible cases that may arise during the testing process. It's important to note that Ollama is a complex software system with many components, so it's recommended to write tests for each part of the code to ensure its functionality and stability. Also, it's essential to use unit tests to check the behavior of individual functions or methods in isolation from other parts of the code, and integration tests to check how the different components work together.
